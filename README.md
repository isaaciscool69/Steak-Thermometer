# Steak-Thermometer
Steak Thermometer Project from Fall 2023 (MicroPython)
Our project goal was to build a steak thermometer that notifies its user when their steak is fully cooked. We allow the user to choose a particular cook of the steak (rare, medium rare, medium well, well done), and our code converts this choice to a temperature ceiling that, when reached, notifies the user that their steak is finished cooking. This build, evidently, is designed to ensure its user always reaches their perfect cook of steak, regardless of personal preference.
